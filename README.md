*This repository was made for fun to try out* **SSR** *and measure its perfomance for different frameworks and libraries:*

* [*Angular 2*](https://github.com/ServerSideRender/angular-universalt)
* [*React / Redux*](https://github.com/ServerSideRender/react)
* *Vue 2* (coming soon)
* *Marko.js* (coming soon)
* *and so on...*

## Disclaimer
This is like TodoMVC for server-side rendering. Nothing more. Maybe less... you will never know.

## Testing APP
Testing APP consists of two pages:
* [Main Page](https://github.com/ServerSideRender/server-side-render/wiki/Main-Page)
* [List page](https://github.com/ServerSideRender/server-side-render/wiki/List-Page)

**PS** Yes, APIs are hosted on the same server with renderers and we are cool with it. And yes, all tests were launched on one core. *lol*

Maybe we will change it in the nearest future... *maybe...*
